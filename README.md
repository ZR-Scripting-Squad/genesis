### Features

- ⭐ **free, forever**: the community version is FREE for all users
- 💻 **anywhere, anytime**: works on both client and browser, on all win8+ computers (more platforms coming soon)
- 🕵️ **undetectable, unbannable**: fear no more about repurcussion; this aimbot cannot be detected and cannot get your account banned (if used correctly)
- 🛠️ **unpatchable**: the techniques employed by this aimbot **cannot be patched** and will work **forever**

> [!TIP]
> we recommend using Genesis on the browser, as it will be **completely undetectable**. If used on client, it can theoretically be detected. If you **must** use the client, we recommend using an alt account with a VPN.

### Guide

| Controls | Installation |
|-|-|
| Press **Alt + G** to toggle, **Alt + Q** to quit and **Alt + P** to toggle aimbot prediction.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <img src="https://github.com/ZR-Scripting-Squad/genesis/assets/157523173/c8b6dea9-6989-49a1-851a-678ab02f312c" height="0" width="1000px" />  | It's quick n' easy.<br><br><br>After downloading the `.zip` file, extract it and run the `exe` inside. Make sure that if you move the location of the executable, you move the other files with it too.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We do not guarantee that you will be free from repurcussions for using our aimbot. The fight between aimbots and the devs is a cat and mouse game - the game will block it, then we will release a patch to evade it, and the process repeats. Always download the latest version (make sure you've joined our discord server @ [bit.ly/zr-hacks](https://bit.ly/zr-hacks) for updates) and always follow our security suggestions.
